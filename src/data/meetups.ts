We'll see some options that we have for a cell-based architecture where each part - independent if its assigned to frontend or backend - can be deployed, maintained, and scaled independently. Our goal is to create solutions that are flexible, secure, resource-efficient, and easy to maintain.",

Together we'll build a full portal with some micro frontends in minutes - demonstrating how efficiently this tech stack can be used to deliver values as fast as possible.",

Together, we'll build a new application using Micro Frontends from the ground up. We'll see how Picard.js can help us to get the job done - and what benefits await us. In the new application we'll also integrate some existing micro frontends - just to show that Picard.js is not a replacement, but rather an addition to the how you develop micro frontends.",
