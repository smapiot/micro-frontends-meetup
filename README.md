# Micro Frontends Meetup - Website

In here we store the code for the static Micro Frontends Meetup website.

## Local Development

To develop the website you'll need to clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

Then you can start the development server by running:

```sh
npm start
```

Finally, when you are done just push the code. Any changes in the `main` branch trigger a build and release in GitHub actions.
